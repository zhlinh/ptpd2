Unified Test Plan for PTPd Versions

NOTE: This file is in Emacs org mode, do not adjust the markup unless
absolutely necessary.

* Client

The client needs to be tested in the following matrix.  For each test
there is a relevant config file listed.

|        | E2E                    | P2P |
| Socket | client-e2e-socket.conf |     |
| PCAP   | client-e2e-pcap.conf   |     |

Note that for each configuration file you MUST update the
ptpengine:interface line at the beginning of the file.  No other
changes should be necessary.

* Server

The server is tested with a series of its own clients.  Not optimal
